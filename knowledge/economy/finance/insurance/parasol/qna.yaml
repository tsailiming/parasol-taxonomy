  - context: |
      In the insurance industry, accurately predicting the likelihood of claims is essential for risk assessment and
      policy pricing. However, Parasol insurance claims datasets frequently suffer from class imbalance, where the
      number of non-claims instances far exceeds that of actual claims. This class imbalance poses challenges for
      predictive modeling, often leading to biased models favoring the majority class, resulting in subpar performance
      for the minority class, which is typically of greater interest.
    questions_and_answers:
      - question: What is class imbalance in the context of Parasol insurance claims datasets?
        answer: |
          Class imbalance refers to the situation where the number of non-claims instances far exceeds that of actual
          claims, making predictive modeling difficult and potentially leading to biased models.
      - question: What types of information are included in the Policyholder Information feature?

      - question: What do 'max torque' and 'max power' describe in the dataset?
        answer: |
          'Max torque' and 'max power' describe the engine performance characteristics, which could relate to the
          vehicle’s mechanical condition and claim risks.

        answer: |
          'Engine type' indicates the type of engine, which might have implications for maintenance and claim rates.
      - question: Why is 'region code' important in the insurance claims data?
        answer: |
          'Region code' represents the geographical region of the policyholder, as claim patterns can vary regionally.
      - question: What does 'region density' show, and why is it relevant?
        answer: |
          'Region density' shows the population density of the policyholder’s region, which could correlate with
          accident and claim frequencies.
      - question: How does the number of 'airbags' in a vehicle influence claim probability?
        answer: |
          The number of 'airbags' in a vehicle indicates its safety level, which can influence the probability of
          claims.
